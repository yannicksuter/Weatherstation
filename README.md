This repository contains the code for a Weather Monitoring System implemented on an Arduino platform using the ESP32-DevKit-V1 board. The system is designed to collect data from various sensors and provide weather-related information such as wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, pressure, and rainfall.

#Todo
- reset s35770 internal counter on first bootup (just to be sure it always starts at 0)
- adding power monitoring to HA metrics
- adding wind direction and speed monitoring to HA metrics
- attach solar panels
- casing, CAD parts and outlet

#new pcb revision
- i2c multiplexing
- onboard buck/boost
